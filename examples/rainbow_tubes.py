"""example MeshLabXML script to create a heroic shield

MeshLab is typically used to process existing meshes; this script was created to demonstrate some of MeshLab's mesh creation features as well. It demonstrates combining python functionality (math and flow control) and MeshLab to create a parametric 3D model that's truly heroic!

Note that the final model is composed of separate surfaces. It is not manifold and is e.g. not suitable for 3D printing; it's just a silly example.
