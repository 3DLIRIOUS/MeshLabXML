Files:
The following files are included with MeshLabXML. Note that the values in the 
parentheses in the filenames indicate metadata about the model, specifically 
scale factor (with negative values indicating an inverse scale factor) and 
"up" axis (either Y or Z).

Filename: bunny_raw(-1250Y).ply
MeshLabXML name: bunny_raw
Description: model is identical to the original source, except it has been 
converted to a binary ply file to reduce file size.

Filename: bunny_flat(1Z).ply
MeshLabXML name: bunny
Description: model has had the following changes applied:
    - Scaled to actual size in mm (see "Notes on units and scale" below)
    - Hole under chin has been filled
    - Unreferenced vertices have been deleted
    - Bottom has been sliced flat and placed on the XY plane
    - Model has been rotated to Z up
The above changes result in a model which is watertight and manifold, e.g. 
suitable for 3D printing.

Notes on units and scale:
The units and scale of the original model are unknown. The principals 
involved (Marc Levoy and Greg Turk) were contacted however they no longer 
have this information available. Based on the reported size of the actual 
object (approximately 7.5 inches high and 8 inches long), units of mm and a 
scale factor of 1:1250 is assumed for the original model to approximate the 
correct size.
